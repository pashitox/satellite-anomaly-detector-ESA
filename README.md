# 🛰️ Satellite Anomaly Detector — ESA Missions

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a full-featured anomaly detection system for ESA satellite missions. It integrates multiple data sources, explores mission-specific anomalies, builds a predictive model using XGBoost, and interprets results using SHAP. It’s designed to identify anomalous satellite behavior across three missions and provide technical insights for decision-making and future projections.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Analyze anomalies across ESA-Mission1, ESA-Mission2, and ESA-Mission3  
- Engineer contextual features from raw telemetry and command data  
- Build a robust detection model using machine learning (XGBoost)  
- Apply explainability techniques (SHAP) to evaluate feature importance  
- Project anomaly patterns per mission and category  
- Deploy visual dashboards and export high-level reports
